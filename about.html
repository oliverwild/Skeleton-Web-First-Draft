                Studio Skelton is a London based interior design practice creating considered,
                characterful spaces for boutique hospitality and residential projects. Our work is
                grounded in an appreciation for historic architecture, traditional craftsmanship,
                and the quiet luxury of well-made materials.
            </p>

            <p>
                Founded by designer Josh Skelton, the studio builds on experience gained at leading
                design practices including Thurstan, Boronkay Studio, and Goddard Littlefair. This
                background spans high-end residential homes, boutique hotels, and international
                hospitality projects, bringing a depth of understanding to every stage of the
                design process.

                Josh leads each project with a hands-on, collaborative approach, from early concept
                and detailing through to completion on site. A focus on proportion, joinery,
                materiality, and the integration of antiques informs the studio’s work, pairing
                traditional sensibilities with a quietly contemporary viewpoint.
            </p>

                Skelton Studio creates interiors that feel rooted, lived-in, and timeless. Spaces
                that respect the story of the building while offering comfort, clarity, and
                longevity.
